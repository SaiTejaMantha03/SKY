<h1>Hashira arc</h1>
<h2>
    The Hashira are the strongest warriors in Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba.
    They're arguably the most significant characters in the story, as they seek to eradicate the demon menace and bring peace to the world.
    The Hashira are led by Kagaya Ubuyashiki, who only allows the strongest fighters to join the Corps.
    They are always searching for a successor to pass their techniques on to after their death or retirement.
